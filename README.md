# TASK8-COVID-DATA-ANALYSIS
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) . My task was to Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on COVID-19 Data of the world to Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread.
I have used Streamlit to create a dashboard of the analysis that I have conducted. 

To run a streamlit project, Just open the .py file through a python editor(I have used VS Code, its works good with streamlit) then go to the terminal, change the directory to the folder where you've saved the project then type streamlit run filename.py

Also, I've used Plotly for the various visualizations in the Dashboard.

I've also uploaded a pdf file that contains all the images of the dashboard.
